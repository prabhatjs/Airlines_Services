Sequelize supports the standard associations: One-To-One, One-To-Many and Many-To-Many.
--*database level association---------
To do this, Sequelize provides four types of associations that should be combined to create them:
example--airpost city belongs to citytable where city id is primary key and in airport cityid is foreign key


*one city has many airports but one airports belongs to only one City
airport model is belongs to city city id is foreign key

--this.belongsTo(models.city,{
      foreignKey:'cityId',
      onDelete:'CASCADE',
      onUpdate:'CASCADE'
    });

--*javascript level association--

The HasOne association
The BelongsTo association
The HasMany association
The BelongsToMany association
